A tool for aligning or syncing maps from one point to another.

In Fusion 360, there’s a feature called Calibrate — you select two points, specify the real-world distance between them, and the software automatically scales the model accordingly.

For World of Warcraft and Artillery DOS XR, I’ll need a similar tool to synchronize a 3D mesh with 2D imagery.

The concept is to select two matching points — one pair on the 3D mesh and one pair on the image — and let the tool automatically align their positions.

Once calibrated, when you provide a GPS coordinate, the tool can estimate its corresponding location on the map.
